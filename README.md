Balance: A Logic Puzzle With Balls, can you find the defective ball?


A Logical game inspired by a famous variation of weighing coin math problems.

In this game you have 12 balls, 11 of them have the same weight and 1 of them has a different weight, 
it could be heavier or lighter. You have a two plate's scale and your goal is to find which ball has a different weight, 
and if it is heavier or lighter than the others. You have to find this out with just three weighings to get the best score.

Older Version
=======
My first version of the game http://fsvieira.com/balls12/#/play, it has a diferente interface, with this new version 
I wanted to try a more clean and compact interface that maybe its too abstract but in some ways I think its better and
other ways it may be worse.
